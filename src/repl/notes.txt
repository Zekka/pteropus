Plans:

- The repl has its own stack frame, represented as a hashtable.
- The repl compiles each statement in isolation, then prepares a stack frame that includes the needed values, moved or copied from the repl's stack frame.
- The repl then runs the code and copies the relevant values back out into its stack frame.
